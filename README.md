# Gather - A Nostr-based Social Gathering App

Gather is a community-first social app that makes it easy to discover, create, and join events in real time. Unlike traditional event platforms, Gather captures the fluid, word-of-mouth nature of how people actually make plans‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a casual coffee meetup, a last-minute study group, or a local neighborhood gathering.

This project is an open-source implementation of the Gather concept on the decentralized Nostr protocol, optimized for both desktop and mobile web.

## ‚≠ê Core Features

*   **Map-First UX:** A live, spatial map is the primary interface. Events are displayed as markers on the map, centered on the user's location.
*   **Multi-Platform Login:** Flexible and secure login options:
    *   **Desktop:** NIP-07 browser extensions (Alby, Nos2x, etc.).
    *   **Mobile:** NIP-46 Nostr Connect for mobile signing apps (e.g., Amethyst, Damus).
    *   Direct login with an `nsec` private key (with security warnings).
*   **Geo-Relay System for Enhanced Discovery:**
    *   **Dynamic Publishing:** Events are published to the user's default relays *and* the relay geographically closest to the event's location.
    *   **Dynamic Subscriptions:** As the user pans the map, the app dynamically connects to the closest relays to fetch location-specific events, improving speed and relevance.
*   **Event Creation & Discovery:**
    *   Click anywhere on the map to create a new event.
    *   Filter between "Live Now" and "Upcoming" events.
*   **Communities:**
    *   Create and join public communities.
    *   Create events for specific communities.
    *   Filter the map to show only public events or events from your joined communities.
*   **Social Interaction:**
    *   **RSVPs:** Attend and un-attend events.
    *   **Attendee Profiles:** View the profiles of users attending an event.
    *   **Event Chat:** Each event has a dedicated, real-time chat for attendees.
*   **Live Proximity:** A privacy-preserving "check-in" feature allows users to signal their physical presence at an event, providing a real-time count of who is currently there.
